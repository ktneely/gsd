  GSD repository
--==============--
This is a collection of scripts that will likely be of very little use to you.  At this time, these items are meant to make *my* life easier by automating the mundane productivity and reporting-related things I have to do to actually complete tasks and report on my activities

status.sh
---------
A status report creation script.  Relies heavily on Gina Trapani's todo.sh and the remind scripts available for most platforms.
