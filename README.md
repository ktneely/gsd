  GSD repository
--==============--
This is a collection of scripts that will likely be of very little use to you.  At this time, these items are meant to make *my* life easier by automating the mundane productivity and reporting-related things I have to do to actually complete tasks and report on my activities

status.sh
---------
A status report creation script.  Relies heavily on Gina Trapani's todo.sh and the remind scripts available for most platforms.  Uses the following GTD-style tags to categorize and organize items in the status report:

General:
 - @ tagging:  tagging a word with @ will setup a location context
 - + tagging:  tagging a wod with + will make it a part of a 'project'. In my usage, this is really more of a way to categorize work I do and provide context for a reviewing manager.
Specific:
 - FYI:  Tagging something with 'FYI' will place it only in the 'FYI' section
 - @topic: Tagging something with '@topic' will place it in the "for discussion" section
 - @waiting: Adding '@waiting' to a task item will indicate that you are waiting on someone else to perform an action before you can proceed.   This gets hi-lighted in the report under the 'Actions needed' section
 - +personal: Adding something to the '+personal' project keeps it off the report.  This is for if you want to use the same todo data for work and personal items.
